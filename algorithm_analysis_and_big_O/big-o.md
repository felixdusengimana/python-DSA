### Big O Notation

**What is Big-o notation?**

Big-o notation describes how quickly runtime will grow relative to input 
as input get arbitrarily large. **Big-O** is also known as **asymptotic analysis**.

- It is used to compare efficiency of two or more algorithms solving the same problem.

**Let's examine some points clearly.**

- Remember, we want to compare how quickly runtime will grow based on input, not compare exact runtimes, since those can 
vary depending on hardware.

#### Runtimes of common Big-O Functions
Here is a table of Big-O functions

Big-o--------------------------- Name

1. ----------------------------- Constant
2. log(n) ---------------------- Logarithmic
3. n --------------------------- Linear
4. nlog(n) --------------------- Log Linear
5. n^2     --------------------- Quadratic
6. n^3     --------------------- Cubic
7. 2^n     --------------------- Exponential

Note: 
- if n is going to infinity the constants can be dropped
example: O(3n) and O(2n) are the same, it is O(n).
- If you're asked Big-O consider Worst case.

**Best case (if things match in first items of a list.) Big-O is O(1).**
**Worst case(if things match in last items or doesn't match) **
